	abstract = {Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) is an emerging soft actuator with attributes of ï¬‚exibility, large strain, and high energy density. Bistable mechanisms have two force-free stable equilibrium positions in their range of motion, which can hold for a long time without energy consumption. In the present work, a design of bistable system is proposed, consisting of a cross-like shape buckling beam and two conical dielectric elastomer actuators. Analytical model has been developed to analyze the electromechanical coupling behavior of dielectric elastomer and the force-displacement relationship of the crosslike shape buckling beam. The working principle of the bistable conical DEAs is explained in terms of force equilibrium method and internal energy of the system. A bistable dielectric elastomer actuator with a switching force of 0.05 N and a stroke of 5.65 mm is developed to validate the analytical model of the conical DEAs, pre-compressed bistable cross-like beam, and the design.},
