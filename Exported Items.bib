	abstract = {Ionic polymer metal composites (IPMCs) are electro-active polymers with excellent electromechanical coupling properties. They are efficient candidates in many advanced technological applications such as actuators, artificial muscles, biomimetic sensors, etc. The manufacturing of electrodes for IPMCs is very critical in their electromechanical coupling. Force optimization, selection of cations and particle size distribution within the IPMC structure, etc. are the various factors, which determines their efficiency. In this chapter, we briefly discuss the structure, components and working mechanisms of IPMCs. The synthesis and characterizations of IPMCs are discussed in detail with the help of examples. A brief outlook on the modeling and potential applications of IPMCs is also included.},
