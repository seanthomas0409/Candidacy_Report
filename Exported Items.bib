	abstract = {\textit{There is a strong need to replicate natural muscles with artificial materials as the structure and function of natural muscle is optimum for articulation. Particularly, the cylindrical shape of natural muscle fiber and its interconnected structure promote the critical investigation of artificial muscles geometry and implementation in the design phase of certain platforms. Biomimetic robots and Humanoid Robot heads with Facial Expressions (HRwFE) are some of the typical platforms that can be used to study the geometrical effects of artificial muscles. It has been shown that electroactive polymer and shape memory alloy artificial muscles and their composites are some of the candidate materials that may replicate natural muscles and showed great promise for biomimetics and humanoid robots. The application of these materials to these systems reveals the challenges and associated technologies that need to be developed in parallel. This paper will focus on the computer aided design (CAD) models of conductive polymer and shape memory alloys in various biomimetic systems and Humanoid Robot with Facial Expressions (HRwFE). The design of these systems will be presented in a comparative manner primarily focusing on three critical parameters: the stress, the strain and the geometry of the artificial muscle.}},
