\section{Originality of the Research} \label{sec:originality}
The originality of this work lies in the pursuit of designing a gripper system that can harness the high work output of shape memory alloys. The gripper will be inspired by the various innovative smart technology explored within the state of the art. The state of the art shows that there exist many novel ideas for compact, light weight actuators using smart materials but non that are capable of delivering the high work output seen in SMAs. By harnessing the strengths of the SMA and the innovative strategies used in other smart material actuator systems, this research aims to explore the capabilities of the SMA material and develop an innovative gripper system. The following topics are expected to be studied over the course of this research project :
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Investigation of the SMA capabilities through the study of an analytical and finite element model
  \item Optimization of the topology of the active material component in the system for increased performances
  \item Optimization of heating and cooling strategies of the SMA so as to decrease response times and bandwidth
  \item Design and integration of a bistable system that incorporates an active smart material such as an SMA to achieve a responsive and powerful gripper system
\end{enumerate}
