	abstract = {This brief describes a new model for shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators based on the physics of the process and develops control strategies using the model. The model consists of three equations - the temperature dynamics described by Joules heating-convectional cooling, the mole fraction distribution with temperature given by statistics to describe a two state system, and a constitutive equation relating the changes in temperature and mole fraction to the stress and strain induced in the SMA. This model is used to develop two control schemes for controlling the strain in an SMA actuator. The first control scheme describes a gain-scheduled proportional-integral (PI) controller, the gains of which are obtained by means of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimization. The second control scheme is an Hinfin loop-shaping controller using normalized coprime stabilization which ensures robust stability by minimizing the effect of unmodeled dynamics at high frequencies. Simulation and experimental results show fast and accurate control of the strain in the SMA actuator for both control schemes.},

	abstract = {There has been great demand for shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators within the field of micro-machines. However, the thermomechanical behavior of SMA actuators is too complicated to accurately predict their response. Moreover the tracking control accuracy of SMA actuators is limited due to the inherent hysteresis nonlinearity. The paper presents a model of an SMA actuator for use in mechanical design and a control system for compensating the hysteresis. First, the model based on constitutive laws developed by Brinson et al. (1996) and our proposed hysteresis model is demonstrated. Next, we propose a control system composed of a proportional integral derivative (PID) feedback loop and a feedforward loop. In the feedforward loop, the desired control input corresponding to the desired displacement is obtained from a static SMA model derived by modifying the classic Preisach hysteresis model. We also propose a method for identifying parameters of the hysteresis model. This methods demands only measurement of the major loop. Application of the control system to our developed SMA actuator shows that the tracking control performance is improved},

	abstract = {Previous studies by the authors and their co-workers show that the structure of equations representing shape
Memory Alloy (SMA) constitutive behaviour can be very similar to those of rate-independent plasticity
models. For example, the Boyd–Lagoudas polynomial hardening model has a stress-elastic strain constitutive
relation that includes the transformation strain as an internal state variable, a transformation function
determining the onset of phase transformation, and an evolution equation for the transformation strain. Such
a structure allows techniques used in rate-independent elastoplastic behaviour to be directly applicable to
SMAs. In this paper, a comprehensive study on the numerical implementation of SMA thermomechanical
constitutive response using return mapping (elastic predictor-transformation corrector) algorithms is presented.
The closest point projection return mapping algorithm which is an implicit scheme is given special attention
together with the convex cutting plane return mapping algorithm, an explicit scheme already presented in an
earlier work. The closest point algorithm involves relatively large number of tensorial operations than the
cutting plane algorithm besides the evaluation of the gradient of the transformation tensor in the
ow rule and
the inversion of the algorithmic tangent tensor. A uni ed thermomechanical constitutive model, which does
not take into account reorientation of martensitic variants but uni es several of the existing SMA constitutive
models, is used for implementation. Remarks on numerical accuracy of both algorithms are given, and it is
concluded that both algorithms are applicable for this class of SMA constitutive models and preference can
only be given based on the computational cost. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

These devices mostly use electrical actuators. Also for the presented research, the interest in designing actuators based on shape Memory Alloys emerged from a study in the field of multi-fingered robot hands. Shape Memory Alloy actuation is very attractive because of the very high power density that can be obtained using these materials. When calculating the ratio of actuator output to actuator volume, also called power density, SMA actuators offer even higher values than hydraulic actuation. Nevertheless, controlling these actuators and implementing them in robotic systems is not so straightforward. This paper defines a number of design rules for shape memory alloy based robotic actuators. It is demonstrated that SMA actuation offers very attractive properties for example in space applications and especially in a zero-gravity environment. This paper also shows that, when using an appropriate cooling method, accurate position control for Shape Memory Alloy actuators can be obtained.},

Alloys of nickel and titanium, and in particular Nitinol are of special interest in the medical device industry, because of their shape memory and superelastic properties. The corrosion behavior of nitinol in the body is also of critical importance because of the known toxicological effects of nickel. The stability of a NiTi alloy in the physiological environment is dependant primarily on the properties of the mostly TiO2 oxide layer that is present on the surface. For the present study, a range of nitinol wires have been prepared using different drawing processes and a range of surface preparation procedures. It is clear from the results obtained that the wire samples with very thick oxides also contain a high nickel content in the oxide layer. The untreated samples with the thicker oxides show the lowest pitting potential values and greater nickel release in both long and short-term experiments. It was also found that after long-term immersion tests breakdown potentials increased for samples that exhibited lower values initially. From these results it would appear that surface treatment is essential for the optimum bioperformance of nitinol. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res, 2006},

Residual stresses from prior cold work can have a major effect on the transformation as shown by measurements of linear contraction, electrical resistance, and calorimetry response following incremental annealing treatments of a cold wrought rod. It is postulated that the retention of an intermediate rhombohedral structure during the transition to martensite is a function of stresses. Precipitation ofthe excess nickel in solution can also generate stresses. Stress reliefofa severely cold wrought rod by annealing at temperatures of 300 to 400°C enables strain recoveries of more than 2.5\%. The purpose this investigation was to: verify and explain the large irreversible “stage 1” contraction reported by Buehler et al.,2 explain the directional dependence of the reversible “stage 2” dimensional changes; explore how a cold drawn alloy recovers the ability to undergo the phase transformation as a function of its annealing; delineate the effect of stresses on the transition; and provide understanding and guidance on techniques for the thermal processing of nickel-rich Nitinol alloys for use in heat-actuated devices.},

	abstract = {Crystal structure, composition and morphology of the precipitate in an aged Ti-51 at\%Ni shape memory alloy have been examined by means of high voltage and high resolution analytical electron microscopy. As a result, the following have been clarified. The precipitate possesses a rhombohedral structure with a=0.670 nm and α=113.8° and contains 14 atoms in the unit cell. The compositional ratio in the unit cell is deduced to be Ni4Ti3, from consideration of space group. The composition is well consistent with Ni56Ti44 experimentally obtained from energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, within experimental error. The crystal structure is a slight modification of the B2 structure of matrix. The calculated intensity distribution in reciprocal space based on the structure model is in qualitative agreement with the observed one. Lenticular morphology of the precipitate, internal \{{\textbackslash}bar15{\textbackslash}bar4\}R twins and antiphase domains are successfully explained by the structure model. On the basis of this knowledge, a relation between the existence of such precipitates and the appearance of all-round shape memory effect is briefly discussed.},

The paper starts from phase diagram, structures of martensites, mechanisms of martensitic transformations, premartensitic behavior, mechanism of shape memory and superelastic effects etc., and covers most of the fundamental issues related with the alloys, which include not only martensitic transformations but also diffusional transformations, since the latter greatly affect the former, and are useful to improve shape memory characteristics. Thus the alloy system will serve as an excellent case study of physical metallurgy, as is the case for steels where all kinds of phase transformations are utilized to improve the physical properties. In short this review is intended to give a self-consistent and logical account of key issues on Ti–Ni based alloys from physical metallurgy viewpoint on an up-to-date basis.},

The tendency to form an amorphous structure depends on the relative values of the deformation temperature and martensite start (Ms) temperature as follows: it is strongest in initially martensitic alloy, intermediate in a premartensitic austenite, and the weakest in initially thermally stable austenitic alloy. Lowering of the deformation temperature in the range below the martensite finish (Mf) temperature facilitates amorphization. Raising of the deformation temperature in the austenitic temperature range suppresses amorphization. The upper limiting deformation temperature for partial amorphization of the alloy having the highest Ms is located about 300 °C. The upper limiting deformation temperature for actually nanocrystalline structure formation is located about 350 °C for non-aging Ti–Ni alloys and somewhat higher than 400 °C for aged Ti–Ni alloy. The thermomechanical conditions of the equal-channel angular pressing for obtaining actually nanocrystalline structure are recommended. Isothermal martensitic transformation is observed in the Ti-48.5 at.\% Ni alloy as a result of keeping for 10 year at room temperature after high-temperature severe plastic deformation. Increasing the pressure suppresses the tendency to form an amorphous structure. The nanocrystalline structure formed under post-deformation annealing from the amorphous structure remains finer than the nanostructure formed as a result of severe plastic deformation through the annealing temperature range covering a nano-grain size scale.},

A geometrically nonlinear static analysis is first carried out to investigate the deformed shape of a flexible cantilever beam caused by an externally-attached SMA wire actuated electrically. The actuation force applied by the SMA actuator to the beam is evaluated by solving a coupled problem that combines a thermodynamic constitutive model of SMAs with the heat conduction equation in the SMA and the structural model of the beam. To calculate the temperature history of the SMA actuator for given electrical current input, the heat transfer equation is solved with the electrical resistive heating being modeled as a distributed heat source along the SMA wire. The steps in the formulation are connected together through an iterative scheme that takes into account the static equilibrium of the beam and the constitutive relation of SMAs, thus translating an electrical current history input into beam strain output. The proposed model is used to simulate the experimental results, thus demonstrating the feasibility of using SMA actuators for shape control of active flexible structural systems.},

an easy-to-use design tool for engineers. It can predict and describe the behavior of

is further developed based on the one-dimensional model. It can be used to study
the mechanical behavior including shape memory effect of complex SMA structures
that have never been analytically studied, and provide quantitative analysis for many
diverse applications of shape memory alloys.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}


A general design method for shape memory alloy actuators has also been developed
based on the developed constitutive relation and transient thermal considerations.

In the case of the strain amplitude due to the martensitic transformation, the fatigue life in air was shorter than that in water.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and the experimental result of the active position control of a shape memory alloy (SMA) wire actuated composite beam. The composite beam has a honeycomb structure with SMA wires embedded in one of its face sheets for the active actuation. The potential applications of this experiment include thermo-distortion compensation for precision space structure, stern shape control for submarines, and flap shape control for aeronautical applications. SMA wires are chosen as the actuating elements due to their high recovery stress ({\textgreater}500 MPa) and tolerance to high strain (up to 6\%). However, SMA wires are inherently nonlinear and pose a challenge for control design. A robust controller is designed and implemented to actively control the tip position of the composite beam. The experiment set-up consists of the composite beam with embedded SMA wires, a programmable current/voltage amplifier to actuate the SMA wires, an infrared laser range sensor to detect the beam tip displacement, and a real-time data acquisition and control system. The experimental result demonstrates the effectiveness of the robust control.},

Insufficient accuracy using conventional surgical cannulas motivated researchers to provide actuation forces to the cannula's body for compensating the possible errors of surgeons/physicians. In this study, we present the feasibility of using shape memory alloy (SMA) wires as actuators for an active steerable surgical cannula. A three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) model of the active steerable cannula was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of using SMA wires as actuators to bend the surgical cannula. The material characteristics of SMAs were simulated by defining multilinear elastic isothermal stress–strain curves that were generated through a matlab code based on the Brinson model. Rigorous experiments with SMA wires were done to determine the material properties as well as to show the capability of the code to predict a stabilized SMA transformation behavior with sufficient accuracy. In the FE simulation, birth and death method was used to achieve the prestrain condition on SMA wire prior to actuation. This numerical simulation was validated with cannula deflection experiments with developed prototypes of the active cannula. Several design parameters affecting the cannula's deflection such as the cannula's Young's modulus, the SMA's prestrain, and its offset from the neutral axis of the cannula were studied using the FE model. Real-time experiments with different prototypes showed that the quickest response and the maximum deflection were achieved by the cannula with two sections of actuation compared to a single section of actuation. The numerical and experimental studies showed that a highly maneuverable active cannulas can be achieved using the actuation of multiple SMA wires in series.},

Various quantities of magnesium (1, 3, and 5 wt pct) were tested. Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) was used as a production method of the alloys. The samples prepared by SHS were pulverized by a vibrating mill, and the obtained powders were used for consolidation by means of spark plasma sintering. Results showed a significant reduction of the content of undesirable Ti2Ni phase by the addition of magnesium. Further, magnesium increased corrosion resistance and yield strength.},

The control properties of MSMA material is introduced, the operation principle of rotating MSMA actuator is analyzed, the expressions of displacement and rotating speed are derived.

	abstract = {Two different strategies are presented for the control of a positioning actuator based on a ferromagnetic shape memory alloy (FSMA). The actuator consists of two orthogonal pairs of coils that generate a pulsed magnetic field when a bank of capacitors is discharged through one of the coil pairs. The FSMA element is located between the coils and expands when a field perpendicular to the crystal's long axis is applied, and contracts in response to a parallel one. In each case, the deformation of the element remains until a driving force in the opposite direction is applied, therefore operating in a “set-and-forget” mode. The current experimental set-up is capable of achieving submicrometer resolutions. Two discrete control strategies are proposed and compared based on their ability to achieve a position with a given precision and transient behaviour. Taking into account that the energy consumption of the actuator is directly related to the number of control actions, two control strategies aimed to minimize such consumption by reducing the number of actions are presented and their experimental performance described. The first of the proposed strategies has two control modules, one for each pair of coils, while the second approach is based on an event-based PI control algorithm.},

In this paper, we propose a novel MSM based actuator exploiting the characteristics of MSMs. This device is a push-pull actuator where two pieces of MSM act in an opposite way. The magnetic fields are created by two magnetic coils supplied by current pulses. The hysteretic behaviour of the MSM permits to keep a stable position when no current is applied and so limits heat losses in the coils. A model of this actuator is proposed and validated by experiments. A precise position feedback control of the actuator is then achieved using a displacement laser sensor.},

	abstract = {Braille points are varied arrangements of raised dots representing characters which are identified by touch by visually impaired people. A dynamic Braille display which presents Braille points by the up-and-down movement of pins using shape memory alloy (SMA) coil actuators and a magnetic latch has been developed. When the SMA coil actuator is heated by the flow of an electrical current, the compressed SMA extends, causing the pins to move up or down. The magnetic latch mechanism keeps the pins in an up or down state and solves the problem of heat storage and power consumption of the SMA actuator. Six Braille points (2×3) represent one character, the distances between the points being 2–3mm. In order to fabricate a dense array of the SMA-actuated dynamic pins, Ni electroplating is utilized for batch forming of electrical connections between the SMA coil and the electrode on printed circuit boards. Displacement and latching power of each fabricated pin are sufficient for dynamic Braille. Sixteen pins representing two characters and two cursors are modularized to realize a line of dynamic Braille characters by lining up the modules. A control circuit and a driving circuit are mounted on each module to reduce the number of lead wires.},

In MSM materials the magnetic field moves microscopic parts of the material (so-called twins) that leads to a net shape change of the material. In this study, the effect of alloy composition and heat treatment on the microstructure, local composition, and thermal and dilatometric properties of Ni2MnGa alloys were investigated. The results showed that as solidified, off-stoichiometric, alloys had three distinct microstructural features—a Heusler phase, a Mn-rich phase and a eutectic or eutectoid region. Various heat treatment procedures were applied to successfully remove the last phase. Heat treatment was also essential for the production of a distinct martensite transformation in DSC and dilatometry traces and a magnetic shape memory effect. Composition variations from Bridgman growth were large enough that a shift in martensite start temperature might occur in some parts of the alloy, based on literature data for the dependence of martensite start temperature on composition.},

By exploiting the inherent bi-stability in buckled beam and buckled plate structures we have designed a bistable actuator that requires no energy to maintain either of the two stable states. In addition to bistable characteristics we show how such a structure, if constructed from a bending actuator (artificial muscle) such as ionic polymer metal composites (IPMC), may actively switch itself between stable states. Thus the self-switching bistable actuator is an extremely simple and elegant design that requires none of the external actuating mechanics traditionally used. In the analysis we consider the nature of bistable buckled beams and their internal stresses and we propose actuating schema for the movement from one stable state to another. We show how segmentation of a strip actuator can be matched to the desired bistable structure and the intended switching motion. We consider the characteristic buckling modes of axially compressed beams and show how these can suggest efficient control and switching mechanisms. We also present some example applications from the micro-scale upwards, including a tactile display device},

Thus natural bistable structure helps to overcome some problems found in the new materials used for artificial muscle actuators, such as relaxation and non-repeatability. Without electrical stimulation the buckled beam remains in one of two stable positions. Actuating the structure causes it to switch from one state to the other, thus giving a versatile element that can be used as an actuator, mechanical switch or adjustable structural element. The structure can be partially actuated in order to move the actuator with respect to one of the stable states without actually switching state. Likewise a variable force can be generated. We show how initial study of the standard buckled beam model suggests a method for segmenting bending actuator materials such as ionic-polymer metal composites (IPMC) in order to switch between states through low energy paths. We also show how such a structure can be used to construct a cilium-like actuator that generates the standard envelope of power stroke and recovery stroke using a one-degree of freedom input},

The martensitic transformation is controlled by transformation criteria similar to those used in conventional plasticity, and subcycles are modeled by a simple elastic return through the hysteresis. The model is validated through isothermal tensile testing, assisted two-way shape memory testing and stress generation testing, and a good agreement with experimental results is shown.

Two different types of reduced-scale dampers using shape memory alloys have been tested over a range of strain amplitudes, loading frequencies, and temperatures.

The ultimate behavior of the devices was also examined.

The effects of width ratio on the responses of the SMA layers are also discussed. Second, corresponding to the inner loops of the stress-strain curves, the configurations and phase states of the SMA layers with the different shapes are simulated. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the experimental features are also investigated. Third, the effects of boundary conditions are studied, where the free end boundary conditions, the mixed boundary conditions and the clamped boundary conditions are taken into account. The corresponding analytical solutions are derived and the responses of the SMA layers are simulated, which are compared with each other to reveal the effects of boundary conditions. The results obtained in the current paper further demonstrate the validity of the analytical approach for studying the phase transitions in geometrically graded SMA specimens.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the interaction between cyclic phase transitions and plasticity, focusing on the synchronized stress strain evolution with temperature profiles of polycrystalline superelastic NiTi SMA. NiTi column is subjected to displacement-controlled cyclic compressive loading in the room temperature ambient air over the frequency range of 0.0007–40 Hz. At low frequencies (0.0007–0.02 Hz) and intermediate frequencies (0.04–7 Hz), the deformation is dominated by phase transition which couples with the temperature variation. The previously established model in cyclic loading can well predict these results. However, for frequency above 8 Hz, both the temperature and stress oscillations experienced a non-monotonic transient stage in which the plastic deformation of the austenite phase takes place and accumulates due to the more rapid accumulation of hysteresis heat and the resulting increase of temperature at the higher frequency region. Such plastic deformation, as a positive feedback to the heat source under the displacement controlled cyclic loading, in turn helps reduce both the transformation strain and hysteresis heat and eventually reduces the temperature and thus brings the stress below the plastic yielding stress of the material. After this transient stage a new steady-state temperature and stress oscillations are established with pure cyclic phase transition of reduced transformation strain. We conclude that, for given material properties, specimen geometries and ambient, a broader scenario of frequency dependent cyclic behavior of SMA can be established, and in particular, the occurrence of austenite plastic yielding at high frequency region can be used as a positive feedback to protect the material from over-stressing and permanent damage.},

Induction heating of shape memory alloy actuators, specifically tubes that twist about the longitudinal axis, has recently been studied experimentally and computationally using finite element analysis. Reduced-order models for the torsional behavior of shape memory alloy tubes and induction heating of general metallic tubes exist, and thus, it is possible for these thermal and mechanical models to be combined and numerically solved. This work develops and implements an engineering model for inductively heated shape memory alloy tubes based on the reduction of the governing partial differential equations in space and time to an ordinary differential equation in time. An example solution is compared to finite element analysis results and agrees well. Finally, the ordinary differential equation is linearized and solved analytically. The linearized model agrees well with the nonlinear ordinary differential equation and finite element model.},

The primary actuator material is thermally activated Ni–Ti shape memory alloy (SMA), which exhibits remarkably high torque density. Despite the advantages of SMAs for actuator applications—high strain, silent operation, and mechanical simplicity—the response time and energy efficiency limit overall performance. As an alternative to SMA wires, thin SMA sheets are used to fabricate effective yet compact torsional actuators. Also, instead of using conventional Joule heating, an external Ni–Cr heating element is utilized to focus heat on the regions of highest required strain. Various design parameters and fabrication variants are described and experimentally explored in actuator prototypes. Controlled current profiles and discrete heating produces a 20\% faster response time with 40\% less power consumption as compared to Joule heating in a low-profile (sub-millimeter) torsional actuator capable of 180° motion.},

	abstract = {Robotic origami allows rapid prototyping of intelligent robots and machines constructed from thin sheets of functional materials. Multimaterial-based design freedom of origami robots creates functional versatility; however, the design parameters pose challenges in their mechanical layout and fabrication. While the conventional robot design follows a coherent and well-established design process, the construction of origami robots requires close study of their three-dimensional (3-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) geometries, compliant mechanisms, functional material specific components, and 2-D fabrication methods. In this paper, we report a systematic design methodology for building origami-inspired machines and robots based on these four essential design features. We provide their comprehensive formulation, comparing them to conventional robots and highlighting design challenges as well as potentials. We demonstrate the applicability of our procedure to the majority of origami robots in the literature and also validate it by designing a centimeter-scale jumping and crawling origami robot, Tribot, as a showcase. The 6-g Tribot crawls with fixed steps in a closed loop, adjusts its vertical jumping height by power modulation, and overcomes obstacles of 45-mm height by side jumps. This paper advances the design and fabrication methodology of origami robots, with customizable functionality from the ground-up.},

	abstract = {A shape memory alloy (SMA) coil spring actuator is fabricated by annealing an SMA wire wound on a rod. Four design parameters are required for the winding: the wire diameter, the rod diameter, the pitch angle and the number of active coils. These parameters determine the force and stroke produced by the actuator. In this paper, we present an engineering design framework to select these parameters on the basis of the desired force and stoke. The behavior of the SMA coil spring actuator is described in detail to provide information about the inner workings of the actuator and to aid in selecting the design parameters. A new static two-state model, which represents a force–deflection relation of the actuator at the fully martensitic state ( M 100\% ) and fully austenitic state ( A 100\% ), is derived for use in the design. Two nonlinear effects are considered in the model: the nonlinear detwinning effect of the SMA and the nonlinear geometric effect of the coil spring for large deformations. The design process is organized into six steps and is presented with a flowchart and design equations. By following this systematic approach, an SMA coil spring actuator can be designed for various applications. Experimental results verified the static two-state model for the SMA coil spring actuator and a case study showed that an actuator designed using this framework met the design requirements. The proposed design framework was developed to assist application engineers such as robotics researchers in designing SMA coil spring actuators without the need for full thermomechanical models.},

The fatigue life in both the pulsating torsion and the alternating torsion is expressed by the unified relationship of the dissipated work in each cycle.

For systems that intend to maximize heat transfer, the critical radius defines the optimal radius for a specific scenario. For systems that intend to minimize heat transfer, the crossover radius defines the radius required to achieve an equal heat transfer rate to the un-insulated scenario; with any further increase in radii resulting in a monotonic reduction in the associated heat transfer rate. The critical radius is well defined for the steady-state scenario. In recent literature, the steady-state crossover radius has also received attention; however, the literature does not provide clarity for the transient scenario. This work overcomes this identified limitation by quantifying the crossover and critical radii of a transient cylindrical system, allowing novel conclusions to be drawn between the steady-state and transient scenarios. In particular, this work identifies that the cycle-average heat transfer rate can stabilize to a quasi-static value in response to transient heating.},

	abstract = {In situations that demand the use of the high-bandwidth, high-quality sense of vision for interactions with the physical world it would be beneficial to have a wearable tactile display that takes advantage of touch to communicate information to the user without causing visual distractions. This thesis presents the design and development of a novel actuator that can be configured into thin, flexible arrays to meet this need for wearable tactile displays. The actuator presented uses the strain recovery property of the martensitic transformation of Nitinol, a Shape Memory Alloy (SMA), to generate the actuation force. A compliant bistable mechanism provides the restoring force that prestrains the martensitic Nitinol, and thus makes the actuator binary. Binary actuation alleviates some of the problems that would otherwise limit the effectiveness of Nitinol in wearable haptic systems. To increase the potential for commercial success, manufacturability issues are considered throughout the development cycle to ensure the potential for economical large scale production. The paper concludes with the presentation of three different prototypes. Their successes and failures are discussed along with recommendations for future work.},

	abstract = {Bistable structures are attractive morphing components because they can transform from one stable state to another simply through the application of an external force or moment. Each stable state is preserved despite the absence of a continuous energy supply. However, its competency is quite limited because most bistable composites (unsymmetric laminated bistable composites) have limited equilibrium shape configurations after curing. Most of them are cylindrical in shape. In this paper, for the first time, we present a saddle-shaped bistable panel that can be used for various soft-morphing applications. The mechanics of the saddle-shaped, bistable panel are investigated using the Rayleigh–Ritz approximation. A simple analytical model is proposed to obtain saddle bistability and deformations. Finite element (FE) numerical analysis is also performed to validate the analytical model approach. The numerical FE analysis shows good correlation with simple analytical solutions. Furthermore, for practical, smart-structure applications of the saddle-shaped bistable panel, the FE method simulated a snap-through action induced by a shape memory alloy (SMA) spring actuator. A simple design criterion for the snap-through action of a saddle composite panel actuated by an SMA spring component is suggested, based on the FE analysis.},

They also suffer low-actuation work densities, which translate to low forces. We investigate the use of the shape-memory effect (SMA) in sputter-deposited thin-film shape-memory alloy (SMA) titanium nickel (TiNi) as an actuator for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based microfluidic devices, as it is capable of both high force and high strains. The resistivity of the SMA thin film is suitable for Joule heating, which allows direct electrical control of the actuator. Two micropump designs were fabricated-one with a novel complementary actuator and the other with a polyimide-biased actuator-which provided thermal isolation between the heated microactuator and the fluid being pumped. A maximum water flow rate of 50 μl/min was achieved},

Piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials exhibit rapid response, but their strokes are small. In shape memory alloys, strokes are large, but their control is slow due to thermomechanical control. Magnetic control of the shape memory effect was recently suggested by the present author for a principle of new kinds of actuator materials. These materials can develop strains of several percent, and their control is rapid and precise. Actuation of these materials is based on the reorienting of the twin structure of martensite or the motion of austenite-martensite interfaces by applied magnetic field. In the present report, magnetically induced motion of the austenite-martensite interfaces is demonstrated in an Fe-33.5Ni alloy.},

One disadvantage of these thermally driven actuators is their slow cyclic time response compared to conventional actuators. Induction heating has recently been proposed to quickly heat SMA components. However efforts to date have been purely empirical. The present work approachs this problem in a computational manner by developing a finite element model of induction heating in which the time-harmonic electromagnetic equations are solved for the Joule heat power field, the energy equation is solved for the temperature field, and the linear momentum equations are solved to find the stress, displacement, and internal state variable fields. The combined model was implemented in Abaqus using a Python script approach and applied to SMA torque tube and beam actuators. The model has also been used to examine magnetic flux concentrators to improve the induction systems performance. Induction heating experiments were performed using the SMA torque tube, and the model agreed well with the experiments.},

	abstract = {Phase transitions are universal phenomena which provide an important field of study for thermodynamics. It is therefore appropriate that thermodynamics should be applied to phase transitions and twinning processes of shape memory alloys. In this contribution, we develop thermodynamics and statistical thermodynamics of a simple one-dimensional model for a crystalline body which has an austenitic phase and martensitic twins. We recognize that the model permits the calculation of a free energy function which predicts martensite as the stable phase at low temperature and austenite as an entropically stabilized phase at high temperature. The phase transitions in shape memory alloys are hysteretic, and we consider hysteresis as a consequence of coherency between the phases. In this manner, it is possible to relate the size of the hysteresis to the interfacial energy and to predict the release of latent heat during the transition. A phase diagram can be constructed in the temperature-deformation plot and it is interesting to calculate the subtle changes which coherency predicts for the shape of the phase diagram. The Gibbs phase rule no longer applies in the usual form. The proper treatment of the metastability within the hysteresis loops is still a mystery. We discuss this point but do not resolve it. Our model permits the simulation of the response of a tensile specimen to a thermodynamic input. Thus, we are able to calculate the deformation and all phase fractions as functions of time if the load and the temperature are prescribed as functions of time. In particular, we can simulate isotherms in a load-deformation diagram that represent quasiplasticity at low temperature and pseudoelasticity at high temperature.},

Experiment shows that the actuator only requires a high-voltage pulse to drive the structure forward and backward with electromechanical snap-through instability. The actuator can maintain its stroke when the voltage is removed. An analytical model based on continuum mechanics is developed, showing good agreement with experiment.

	abstract = {A new approach to the design and control of shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators is presented. SMA wires are divided into many segments and their thermal states are controlled individually as a group of ﬁnite state machines. Instead of driving a current to the entire SMA wire and controlling the wire length based on the analog strain–temperature characteristics, the new method controls the binary state (hot or cold) of individual segments and thereby the total displacement is proportional to the length of the heated segments, i.e. austenite phase. Although the thermomechanical properties of SMA are highly nonlinear and uncertain with a prominent hysteresis, segmented binary control is robust and stable, providing characteristics similar to a stepping motor. However, the heating and cooling of each segment to its bi-stable states entail longer time and larger energy for transition. In this paper, an efﬁcient method for improving the speed of response and power consumption is developed by exploiting the inherent hysteresis of SMA. Instead of keeping the extreme temperatures continuously, the temperatures return to intermediate ‘hold’ temperatures closer to room temperature but sufﬁcient to keep constant phase. Coordination of the multitude of segments having independent thermal states allows for faster response with little latency time even for thick SMA wires. Based on stress dependent thermomechanical characteristics, the hold temperature satisfying a given stress margin is obtained. The new control method is implemented using the Peltier effect thermoelectric devices for selective segment-by-segment heating and cooling. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Stimulus-responsive materials are able to response to a particular stimulus, such as, heat, chemical, and light. As such, they are smarter and more intelligent than ordinary materials. While in most stimulus-responsive materials, the result is limited to a change in their certain physical/chemical properties, stimulus-responsive shape memory materials (SMMs) are able to recover their original shape, after being quasi-plastically distorted. SMMs are ideal for an integrated intelligent system, in which “The material is the machine” that can sense and then generate reactive motion as pre-programmed. This paper presents a brief review on the current progress in stimuli-responsive SMMs, from recent development in traditional shape memory alloys (SMAs) and shape memory polymers (SMPs) to newly emerged shape memory hybrids (SMHs), which open the door for ordinary people to design their own SMMs in a do-it-yourself (DIY) manner. The focus of this review is on twofold, namely phenomena, in particular those newly observed ones, and novel applications with great potential at present and in near future.},

In the present work, the time response of various types of Ni-Ti actuators having different transformation temperatures and geometrical sizes, is studied systematically under conditions of free and forced air convection., The simple analytical model for calculating the time response is developed which accounts for the latent heat and thermal hysteresis of transformation. For all the types of considered actuators, the calculated time response is in a good agreement with that observed experimentally. Finally, on the base of the suggested model, we present the time response of Ni-Ti actuators calculated as a function of their transformation temperature and cross section dimensions.},

In this study, we investigate various active cooling techniques and effect of pre-stress to improve the response time of two commercially available SMAs: Flexinol from Dynalloy Inc. and Biometal fiber from Toki Corporation. Flexinol and Biometal fiber of equal length and diameter were found to exhibit different actuation behavior under pre-stress. Time domain force response of SMA actuators was found to be dependent upon the applied pre-stress, heating rate, and amplitude of applied electrical stimulus. Compared to Biometal fibers, time domain response of Flexinol was found to decrease significantly with increasing pre-stress indicating the difference in transformation behavior. Fluid flow and heat sinking were found to be suitable methods for improving the response time by reducing the cooling cycle from 1.6 s to 0.30—0.45 s. This is a significant improvement in the actuation capability of SMAs.},

NiTiCuV alloys exhibit large latent heats and a small mechanical hysteresis, which may potentially lead to the development of efficient solid-state-based cooling processes. The paper starts with a brief introduction to the underlying principles of elastocaloric cooling, illustrating the effect by means of a typical thermodynamic cycle. It proceeds with the description of a custom-built testing platform that allows observation of temperature profiles and heat transfer between SMA and heat source/sink during high-loading-rate tensile tests. Similar to other SMA applications, a training process is necessary in order to guarantee stable performance. This well-known mechanical stabilization affects the stress–strain hysteresis and the cycle-dependent evolution of differential scanning calorimetry results. In addition, it can be shown here that the training is also accompanied by a cycle-dependent evolution of temperature profiles on the surface of an SMA ribbon. The applied training leads to local temperature peaks with intensity, number, and distribution of the temperature fronts showing a cycle dependency. The homogeneity of the elastocaloric effect has a significant influence on the efficiency of elastocaloric cooling process and is a key aspect of the specific material characterization.},

Properties of the constituents are assumed to be temperature-dependent. Donnell's kinematic assumptions accompanied with the von-Karman type of geometrical non-linearity are used to derive the governing equations of the shell. Furthermore, the one-dimensional constitutive law of Brinson is used to predict the behavior of shape memory alloy fibers through the heating process. Governing equilibrium equations are established by employing the static version of virtual displacements principle. Linear membrane pre-buckling analysis is performed to extract the pre-buckling deformations of the shell. Applying the well-known adjacent equilibrium criterion to the pre-buckling state of the shell, stability equations are derived. The governing equations are solved via a semi-analytical solution employing the exact trigonometric function in circumferential direction and the harmonic differential quadrature method in the longitudinal direction. Numerical results cover various cases of edge supports, cross-ply lamination, shape memory alloy fibers volume fraction and shape memory alloy fiber pre-strain.

They have finally matured to the extent where they can be utilized in reasonably accurate numerical analysis of potentially complex shape memory alloy devices subjected to non-trivial thermomechanical loading.

	abstract = {Shape memory alloys (SMA) are uniquely alloyed metals that have the ability to change crystalline structure upon the application or removal of stress or upon heating or cooling. This change in crystalline structure gives SMA several properties that make them useful in robotics applications. For example, certain SMA can be used to create actuators that are simple, high strength, and inexpensive. However, poor electrical efficiency, a moderate lifetime, and complex mechanical behavior that makes them difficult to design into new applications and products have stymied the growth of these actuators as viable alternatives to more traditional actuators such as pneumatics or motors. In order to improve the integration of SMA actuators into modern mechanical applications, tools have been created that account for the complex thermal and mechanical behaviors of these materials under feedback controls. This was done through the development of thermo-electro-mechanical constitutive models which were then analyzed analytically and then solved numerically using routines present in multibody dynamics software ADAMS as well as through programs such as MATLAB. Models of varying complexity were implemented and compared to one another as well as to experimental results. The mechanical model utilizes 1-D constitutive equations that account for the material temperature and state of stress to determine the material state. The material state determines the electrical resistivity of the material, which drives Joule heating. Thermal cooling of the material is based on a heat transfer analysis of various geometries. These models contain information on material states that are very difficult to measure experimentally (such as crystalline phase fraction) and thus provide insight into the material behavior and design that experimental results cannot offer. The numerical models of material behavior also can then be used with a variety of control laws in order to test their stability and response time.},

	abstract = {This article presents the experimental study on the influence of stress generated between the antagonistically connected shape memory alloy wire actuators over its bandwidth of operation. It is a well-known fact that behaviour of shape memory alloy is strongly coupled with temperature, stress and strain. An attempt is made to understand the effect of these factors on its bandwidth from control perspective through frequency response analysis. A phenomenological correlation is presented between the frequency response of antagonistic shape memory alloy and stress acting between the wires under different strains and temperatures. A clear demarcation between influence of temperature and stress over the operating frequency is discussed. Experimental result shows that apart from temperature, operating frequency of antagonistically connected shape memory alloy is also highly influenced by stress acting between the wires at higher temperatures. Also, the effect becomes much more significant under partial transformation strain. The result of the study is extended and demonstrated through tracking control of antagonistic shape memory alloy at a frequency of about 2 Hz.},

The new setup enables the force and displacement generated by the phase transforming wire to be measured with a μs time resolution. In addition, part of the tests incorporated high-speed infrared and visible light photography. The experimental system enables exploring several unique dynamic effects. In particular, stress levels of 1.6 GPa with negligible plastic deformation and elastic strain rates of 103 s−1 are observed. Force measurements reveal a dead time of {\textasciitilde}20 μs between the end of the electric pulse and the onset of the stress rise in the SMA wire. The high strain rate, generated by the phase transformation, induces string-like vibrations of the SMA wire that result in strong stress vibrations. The developed experimental system opens the way for studying the kinetics of the phase transformation.},

	abstract = {Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) materials are widely used as an actuating source for bending actuators due to their high power density. However, due to the slow actuation speed of SMAs, there are limitations in their range of possible applications. This paper proposes a smart soft composite (SSC) actuator capable of fast bending actuation with large deformations. To increase the actuation speed of SMA actuator, multiple thin SMA wires are used to increase the heat dissipation for faster cooling. The actuation characteristics of the actuator at different frequencies are measured with different actuator lengths and results show that resonance can be used to realize large deformations up to 35 Hz. The actuation characteristics of the actuator can be modified by changing the design of the layered reinforcement structure embedded in the actuator, thus the natural frequency and length of an actuator can be optimized for a specific actuation speed. A model is used to compare with the experimental results of actuators with different layered reinforcement structure designs. Also, a bend-twist coupled motion using an anisotropic layered reinforcement structure at a speed of 10 Hz is also realized. By increasing their range of actuation characteristics, the proposed actuator extends the range of application of SMA bending actuators.},

Under tension, a flat stress-plateau occurs, while under compression, the material is quickly strain hardened and no flat stress-plateau is observed. Cyclic deformation under tension–compression also shows that it is more difficult to deform the material during compression than during tension, where an asymmetric stress–strain loop is obtained. TEM observations show that, under tension to 4\% strain, martensite variants are partially reoriented via migration of variant interfaces with formation of dislocation networks mainly along the junction plane areas, and no significantly plastic deformation has been observed inside the martensite twin bands. While under compression to 4\% strain, a high density of dislocations has been generated in both the martensite twin bands and the variant accommodation area, and no significant martensite reorientation via variant interfacial migration has been observed. This shows that the deformation mechanism of martensitic polycrystalline NiTi SMAs under tension is different from that under compression.},

The present work is focused on the martensite microstructure developed as a result of mechanical cycling. TEM observations show that, before cycling, the martensite variants are well selfaccommodated to each other with the h011i type II twinning as the main lattice invariant shear. After mechanical cycling, the martensite plates are still self-accommodated and the (111) type I twinning is most frequently observed. In addition to the stress-induced re-orientation of martensite and twin boundary movement within the martensite plate, various lattice defects have been developed both in the junction plane areas of martensite plates and within the martensite twins. \# 1998 Acta Metallurgica Inc.},

The polymers were synthesized by photopolymerization from a tert-butyl acrylate monomer with a diethyleneglycol diacrylate crosslinker. Three-point flexural tests were used to systematically investigate the thermomechanics of shape storage (predeformation) and shape recovery. The glass transition temperature, Tg, of the polymers was determined to be approximately 65°C. The polymers show 100\% strain recovery, at low and high predeformation temperatures, up to maximum strains of ∼80\%. The polymers show a sigmoidal free strain recovery response as a function of increasing temperature at a constant heating rate. Free strain recovery was determined to depend on the temperature during predeformation; lower predeformation temperatures (T {\textless} Tg) decreased the temperature required for free strain recovery. Constrained stress recovery shows a complex evolution as a function of temperature and also depends on the temperature during predeformation. Stress recovery after low-temperature predeformation (T {\textless} Tg) shows a peak in the generated recovery stress, whereas stress recovery after high-temperature predeformation (T {\textgreater} Tg) is sigmoidal. The isothermal free strain recovery rate was found to increase with increasing temperature or decreasing predeformation temperature. The thermomechanical results are discussed in light of potential biomedical applications, and a prototype device is presented. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res 73A: 339–348, 2005},

	abstract = {The shape-memory effect has been studied in a titanium −35 wt.-\% niobium alloy. The effect is observed under two different sets of conditions. First, when the fully martensitic alloy is deformed below Ms it recovers its original shape when heated above As Secondly, if the alloy is deformed between Ms and As (with Ms artificially depressed by a fine dispersion of ω-phase precipitates, which prevents the martensite forming on cooling through the expected Ms , a strain-induced martensite is formed and on heating above As the deformation is recovered. When the orthorhombic martensite forms from the cubic β phase, there is an expansion of the unit cell along two axes of the orthorhombic and a contraction along the third. The orientation relationship between the two phases predicts 12 possible variants and on stressing that variant will be formed which results in a relief of the stress, e.g. under a tensile stress those lattice planes with an increased spacing in the orthorhombic phase will tend to lie perpendicular to the stress axis. Deformation below Ms causes growth of certain variants at the expense of others and deformation between Ms and Ms results in different variants being produced under different stress conditions.},

The model accounts for large rotations of the beam cross-section and rather large elastic displacements. Moreover, the model incorporates the extensibility of the elastic beam. The nonlinear nature of the model is used to amplify the transition from one stable position of the buckled beam to the other one. Such mechanical structure is said bistable. The bistable beam is simply supported at each of its ends and is subject to a transverse force applied at a point of the beam. The emphasis is placed especially on the bistable mechanism response caused by the applied force. The stability of the buckled beam is investigated in details and the diagram of the applied force of actuation as function of the midpoint displacement is discussed according to the applied force location. The snap-through phenomenon scenario is analyzed. The switching from one stable state to the other one occurs passing through an instability region in which the second buckling mode is involved. For rather small end shortening of the beam, the post buckling behavior is studied by reducing the solution of the complete elastica model to the first two buckling modes. The reduced model allows us to discuss the switching path in terms of energy required and stability properties of the bistable mechanism. Numerical algorithms are developed in order to solve the strongly nonlinear problem.},

Natural fiber belongs to the earliest known cultivated plants, which have intrinsic properties: low weight, cost, high specific strength, and specific stiffness. These properties have made them particularly attractive to many and varied industrial uses. The factors that should be considered in using natural fibers are safety, mechanical strength, and stiffness improvement of the composites, decreasing the density and environmental issues. This chapter intends to describe the physical and mechanical properties of natural origin fiber fabrics. Also, this chapter is going to study the reinforcing capabilities of natural fiber in different composites. Here, some challenges due to poor compatibility between the fibers and the matrix from a bonding strength point of view will be discussed.},

Upon delineating the Hamiltonian characteristics of the formulation and by using eigenfunction expansion, a rigorous solution which satisfies the end conditions is determined. The results show that the end condition alters the stress significantly only near the end, and elementary solutions in the form of polynomials can give sufficiently accurate results except near the ends.

One such actuator is a pre-shaped buckled beam. In this paper, theoretical analysis reveals that existence of the second stable state in a buckled-beam actuator depends not only on a ratio of its initial rise to its thickness, but also on its residual stress. Buckled-beam actuators are pre-shaped by layout design, fabricated by SU-8 lithography and copper pulse electroplating, and actuated by Lorentz force using an external magnet and current flow through the beams. Forward and backward critical loads or switching currents of the actuators are measured for various beam dimensions, and compared to the theoretical values. Required switching currents and voltages are between 10 and 200mA, and between 20mV and 0.4V, respectively, for 20–60μm displacement. Effect of electroplating conditions to bistability of actuators is studied as well.},

Bistable mechanisms have two force-free stable equilibrium positions in their range of motion, which can hold for a long time without energy consumption. In the present work, a design of bistable system is proposed, consisting of a cross-like shape buckling beam and two conical dielectric elastomer actuators. Analytical model has been developed to analyze the electromechanical coupling behavior of dielectric elastomer and the force-displacement relationship of the crosslike shape buckling beam. The working principle of the bistable conical DEAs is explained in terms of force equilibrium method and internal energy of the system. A bistable dielectric elastomer actuator with a switching force of 0.05 N and a stroke of 5.65 mm is developed to validate the analytical model of the conical DEAs, pre-compressed bistable cross-like beam, and the design.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present our work towards the development of a SMA-actuated meso-scale robot for neurosurgery, which can be operated under MRI guidance. In this robot, we use two antagonistic SMA wires as actuators for each joint, so that each joint can be actuated independently. Due to the size scale of the robot, it is impossible to have individual position sensors at each joint and hence we rely primarily on temperature feedback to control the robot. We thus designed and developed an experimental setup to characterize the SMA wires. The goal of SMA characterization was to develop systematic experiments whereby the dependence of the joint motion on the temperature (and hence the SMA phase transition) can be experimentally determined. We also developed a theoretical model based on Tanaka's model and the geometry of the robot to characterize the joint motion with the change in SMA wire temperature. The results demonstrated that the SMA wire temperature can be used reliably to predict the joint motion of the robot. We then developed a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) scheme to control the temperature of SMA wires (and hence the joint motion). By using PWM control and switching circuits, we can actuate multiple SMA wires simultaneously and independently using only one power supply. Experimental results from our current prototype of a 2-DOF robot show that we can actuate the SMA wires reliably and hence observe joint motion in a gelatin medium as well as in MRI.},

First, the mechanical design of the torsion actuator is presented, followed by the fabrication of SMA torsion springs. Then, we present the constitutive model of the SMA torsion spring with an analysis of its strain change, and derive a quasi-static model with the Coulomb friction torque for this torsion actuator. Finally, a series of characterization experiments are conducted on the SMA torsion spring and the torsion actuator prototype to determine the values of all model parameters. This work shows that the properties of the SMA-actuated torsion actuator can be appropriately characterized by experiments and the actuator is feasible for robotics applications.},

In this work, various parameters such as the dimensions of the beam, shape geometry are studied to determine their effects on the deformation and buckling of the beam under a thermal load. The pre-sizing of the dimensions of the blade shows that the thickness and length of the blade have a minor effect on the maximum displacement of around 0.4 mm. By adapting the geomtry to have variable thickness, the behaviour of the buckled beam was completely changed and was shown to be able to transition to another stable mode. The use of genoemtry optimization allows the division of the beam into segmants that can be speciﬁcally actuated to improve self-switching. The central vertex of the beam was also able to be displaced by 2 mm. This SMA buckled beam system shows promise for use in compact micro-actuator systems.},

	abstract = {The electric resistance, sensitively dependent on the electronic structure and currently used to detect transformation temperatures in shape memory alloys, deserves attention also in the stress transformation domain. In fact, the electric resistance has already been investigated under increasing stress in the martensitic phase of several shape memory alloys : in this case a linear relationship is found between the electric resistance variation and the built-in deformation related to the variant reorientation process, at least in NiTi alloys. In the stress transformation range at constant temperature, the results are less clear, notably in NiTi alloys where two transformations, the Rphase→M and the P→M, are often present. The aim of this paper is to investigate the electric resistance dependence in the pseudoelastic regime in some selected shape memory alloys where one single transformation is present. Attention has been focused here on a Ni25Ti50Cu25 alloy, obtained by melt-spinning, where just the cubic(B2)←→orthorhombic(B19) transformation is present and on a CuAlBe alloy where the cubic(DO3)←→orthorhombic(18R) is expected. Both alloys show good pseudoelastic loops though with different features : the former shows a critical stress to induce the B19 phase constant all along the transformation plateau, whilst the latter shows a linear superelastic behaviour. The electric resistance variation, detected during the stress induced martensitic transformation, shows a nice linear behaviour, reversible with the transformation direction. The results are compared with the ones obtained on NiTi alloys.},

	abstract = {Nickel–Titanium (Ni–Ti) shape memory alloys (SMAs) are commonly applied in commercial actuator design due to the high associated fatigue and tensile strengths, low cost and high activation temperature. Consequently, Ni–Ti SMAs provide an opportunity for the development of novel electromechanical actuators. However, the cooling response time is typically of significantly larger duration than the associated heating response time. The applicability of SMA actuators would be significantly greater if the cooling response time was reduced to allow a symmetric, high speed activation profile. This work provides insight into the opportunities associated with enhancing thermal heat transfer efficiency to achieve this objective. An explicit model of the temperature of Ni–Ti SMA wire is developed to estimate the temperature–time profile during resistive heating. A finite-difference equation is developed to predict the associated temperature during cooling. These models are used to confirm that for a typical scenario, the cooling stage dominates the total response time, and that lagging with a highly conductive media can be used to dramatically reduce the cooling response time. The finite-difference equation is validated against steady state data, and extended to provide insight into the effects of SMA lagging, including the effects of periodic excitation on cooling rate and the minimum observed SMA temperature during a heating cycle. The outcomes of this work are generally applicable to any axisymmetric transient heat transfer optimisation problem.},

The work output per volume of thin film SMA microactuators exceeds that of other microactuation mechanisms such as electrostatic, magnetic, thermal bimorph, piezoelectric, and thermopneumatic, and it is possible to achieve cycling frequencies on the order of 100 Hz due to the rapid heat transfer rates associated with thin film devices. In this paper, a quantitative comparison of several microactuation schemes is made, techniques for depositing and characterizing Ni-Ti-based shape memory films are evaluated, and micromachining and design issues for SMA microactuators are discussed. The substrate curvature method is used to investigate the thermo-mechanical properties of Ni-Ti-Cu SMA films, revealing recoverable stresses up to 510 MPa, transformation temperatures above 32°C, and hysteresis widths between 5 and 13°C.

	abstract = {Pseudoelasticity and the shape memory effect (SME) due to martensitic transformation and reorientation of polycrystalline shape memory alloy (SMA) materials are modeled using a free energy function and a dissipation potential. Three different cases are considered, based on the number of internal state variables in the free energy: (1) austenite plus a variable number of martensite variants; (2) austenite plus two types of martensite; and (3) austenite and one type of martensite. Each model accounts for three-dimensional simultaneous transformation and reorientation. The single-martensite model was chosen for detailed study because of its simplicity and its ease of experimental verification. Closed form equations are derived for the damping capacity and the actuator efficiency of converting heat into work. The first law of thermodynamics is used to demonstrate that significantly more work is required to complete the adiabatic transformation than the isothermal transformation. Also, as the hardening due to the austenite/martensite misfit stresses approaches zero, the transformation approaches the isothermal, infinite specific heat conditions of a first-order transformation. In a second paper, the single-martensite model is used in a mesomechanical derivation of the constitutive equations of an active composite with an SMA phase.},

Therefore, the transformation kinetics formulation is essential for predicting the thermo-mechanical behavior of SMAs. In this work, we show that previous models, including the Brinson model, which is the most widely used one-dimensional phenomenological model, cannot describe the compressive thermo-mechanical behavior of SMAs due to the tension–compression asymmetry. In addition, a new transformation kinetics is derived which precisely predicts the compressive behavior of SMAs based on the following experimental results: (1) drastic variation exists during transformation, and the plastic deformation is not ignored in compression; (2) the plastic deformation increases in proportion to the volume fraction of detwinned martensite; and (3) the critical stress–temperature slopes largely increase and the slopes of the start and finish temperatures of each phase are not identical to each other. Finally, numerical calculations using the suggested transformation equation are conducted to verify its capability through a comparison with the compressive experimental results. According to the results, the suggested transformation kinetics can predict the thermo-mechanical behavior of SMAs more precisely under compression.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an introduction to ionic polymer-metal composites and some mathematical modeling pertaining to them. It further discusses a number of recent findings in connection with ion-exchange polymer-metal composites (IPMCs) as biomimetic sensors and actuators. Strips of these composites can undergo large bending and flapping displacement if an electric field is imposed across their thickness. Thus, in this sense they are large motion actuators. Conversely by bending the composite strip, either quasi-statically or dynamically, a voltage is produced across the thickness of the strip. Thus, they are also large motion sensors. The output voltage can be calibrated for a standard size sensor and correlated to the applied loads or stresses. They can be manufactured and cut in any size and shape. In this paper first the sensing capability of these materials is reported. The preliminary results show the existence of a linear relationship between the output voltage and the imposed displacement for almost all cases. Furthermore, the ability of these IPMCs as large motion actuators and robotic manipulators is presented. Several muscle configurations are constructed to demonstrate the capabilities of these IPMC actuators. This paper further identifies key parameters involving the vibrational and resonance characteristics of sensors and actuators made with IPMCs. When the applied signal frequency varies, so does the displacement up to a critical frequency called the resonant frequency where maximum deformation is observed, beyond which the actuator response is diminished. A data acquisition system was used to measure the parameters involved and record the results in real time basis. Also the load characterizations of the IPMCs were measured and it was shown that these actuators exhibit good force to weight characteristics in the presence of low applied voltages. Finally reported are the cryogenic properties of these muscles for potential utilization in an outer space environment of a few Torrs and temperatures of the order of -140 degrees Celsius. These muscles are shown to work quite well in such harsh cryogenic environments and thus present a great potential as sensors and actuators that can operate at cryogenic temperatures.},

A piezoelectric actuator is a device used for actuating small displacements within the range of 10 pm (1 pm = 10−12 m) to 100 µm. Piezoelectric actuators are widely used in scanning technology due to their high precision, especially in micro/nano technology. There are many limitations such as vibration, creep, and hysteresis that can reduce the accuracy and stability of a piezoelectric actuator. Many efforts have been made to overcome the limitations in terms of mathematical modelling and control approaches. This review includes the piezoelectric actuator design for optical scanners and the development of miniaturize scanners. The types of piezo actuators in scanning technology are categorized by the different configurations such as stack actuator, thin film and tube actuator. Besides, the advantages, limitations and the applications of piezo actuator are included. This paper explains the existing piezo actuator design constraints and applications.},

	abstract = {Electroactive polymers (EAPs) can overcome many limitations of traditional smart material and transducer technologies. A particularly promising class of EAP is dielectric elastomer, also known as electroelastomer. Dielectric elastomer transducers are rubbery polymer materials with compliant electrodes that have a large electromechanical response to an applied electric field. The technology has been developed to the point where exceptional performance has already been demonstrated: for example, actuated strains of over 300 percent. These strains and the corresponding energy densities are beyond those of other field-activated materials including piezoelectrics. Because of their unique characteristics and expected low cost, dielectric elastomer transducers are under development in a wide range of applications including multifunctional (combined actuation, structure, and sensing) muscle-like actuators for biomimetic robots; microelectromechanical systems (MEMS); smart skins; conformal loudspeakers; haptic displays; and replacements for electromagnetic and pneumatic actuators for industrial and commercial applications. Dielectric elastomers have shown unique performance in each of these applications; however, some further development is required before they can be integrated into products and smart-materials systems. Among the many issues that may ultimately determine the success or failure of the technology for specific applications are durability, operating voltage and power requirements, and the size, cost, and complexity of the required electronic driving circuitry.},

However, in practical applications, they have not achieved their full potential. Here, the results of detailed analytical and experimental studies of the failure modes and performance boundaries of DEAs are codified into design principles for these actuators. Analysis shows that the performance of DEAs made with highly viscoelastic polymer films is governed by four key mechanisms: pull-in failure, dielectric strength failure, viscoelasticity and current leakage. Design maps showing the effect of these four mechanisms on performance under varying working conditions are proposed. This study shows that the viscous nature of DEA is very important in their performance/reliability trade-offs. A proper balance of performance and reliability is key to successful design of DEAs.},

	abstract = {Binary systems can lead to simple and efficient robotic and mechatronic systems since such systems use a large number of simple bistable actuators to affect its state. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are prime candidates for use in binary systems since they are simple, low cost, and lightweight. However, previously proposed bistable DEAs (flip-flop) have relatively low volumetric energy density that limits their use in practical devices. This paper investigates the potential of improving the energy density of bistable designs by employing DEAs in compact antagonistic configurations. To do so, two antagonistic configurations (linear and rotating) are designed and studied using an experimentally validated Bergstrom–Boyce viscoelastic material model. The proposed antagonistic configurations show up to ∼10× higher volumetric energy densities than flip-flop designs. This represents a significant advantage for DEA reliability, since, based on volumetric energy density, antagonist actuators require the manufacturing of significantly less film layers than flip-flop designs. This study also reveals that, in the design of antagonistic DEAs, limiting the polymer film's actuation stretch minimizes viscoelastic losses and allows higher actuation speeds and power outputs for a given actuator stroke and size.},

The main body of microgripper is a compact flexure-based mechanical structure with a three-stage amplification mechanism. Based on the three-stage amplification structure, large-range, robust and parallel grasping operation can be realized. The characteristics analyses of the developed microgripper are carried out by finite element analysis (FEA). A position-force switching control strategy is utilized to regulate the position and grasping force of movable jaw. Discrete-time sliding model (DSM) controller is designed to control the position and grasping force. Experimental studies are conducted and the experiment results show that the microgripper exhibits good performance and high precision grasping operations can be realized through the developed control strategy.},

	abstract = {Magnetic shape memory alloys (MSMAs) have recently been developed into a new class of functional materials that are capable of magnetic-field-induced actuation, mechanical sensing, magnetic refrigeration, and energy harvesting. In the present work, the magnetic \&!hyphen;field-induced martensitic phase transformation (FIPT) in Ni45Mn36.5Co5In13.5 MSMA single crystals is characterized as a new actuation mechanism with potential to result in ultra-high actuation work outputs. The effects of the applied magnetic field on the transformation temperatures, magnetization, and superelastic response are investigated. The magnetic work output of NiMnCoIn alloys is determined to be more than 1 MJ m−3 per Tesla, which is one order of magnitude higher than that of the most well-known MSMAs, i.e., NiMnGa alloys. In addition, the work output of NiMnCoIn alloys is orientation independent, potentially surpassing the need for single crystals, and not limited by a saturation magnetic field, as opposed to NiMnGa MSMAs. Experimental and theoretical transformation strains and magnetostress levels are determined as a function of crystal orientation. It is found that [111]-oriented crystals can demonstrate a magnetostress level of 140 MPa T−1 with 1.2\% axial strain under compression. These field-induced stress and strain levels are significantly higher than those from existing piezoelectric and magnetostrictive actuators. A thermodynamical framework is introduced to comprehend the magnetic energy contributions during FIPT. The present work reveals that the magnetic FIPT mechanism is promising for magnetic actuation applications and provides new opportunities for applications requiring high actuation work-outputs with relatively large actuation frequencies. One potential issue is the requirement for relatively high critical magnetic fields and field intervals (1.5–3 T) for the onset of FIPT and for reversible FIPT, respectively.},

	abstract = {This book introduces physical effects and fundamentals of piezoelectric sensors and actuators. It gives a comprehensive overview of piezoelectric materials such as quartz crystals and polycrystalline ceramic materials. Different modeling approaches and methods to precisely predict the behavior of piezoelectric devices are described. Furthermore, a simulation-based approach is detailed which enables the reliable characterization of sensor and actuator materials. One focus of the book lies on piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers. An optical approach is presented that allows the quantitative determination of the resulting sound fields. The book also deals with various applications of piezoelectric sensors and actuators. In particular, the studied application areas are · process measurement technology, · ultrasonic imaging, · piezoelectric positioning systems and · piezoelectric motors. The book addresses students, academic as well as industrial reseachers and development engineers who are concerned with piezoelectric sensors and actuators.},

	abstract = {Recently, a styrenic rubber membrane (commercialized under the name of “THERABAND YELLOW 11726”) demonstrated excellent electromechanical properties for the development of high power density and highly efficient dielectric elastomer transducers (DETs). In particular, in an experimental application as generator, an inflated circular diaphragm DET based on this material made it possible to consistently convert pneumatic energy into electricity at a maximum energy density per cycle and power density greater than 400 J/kg and 650 W/kg, respectively, with even higher numbers being expected for DETs configured so as to have the material working in uniform states of deformation. As for any other existing dielectric elastomer material, these experimented performances can however be sustained for a limited number of cycles only, after which the DET will fail irreversibly. To date, very little information is available on the fatigue life performances of dielectric elastomer materials and of the transducers made thereof. Having identified the electrical breakdown as the most probable mode of DET failure, this paper reports for the first time on a set of lifetime constant-electric-stress tests conducted on the considered styrenic dielectric elastomer membrane. Specifically, the paper starts with a description of the employed experimental set-up and procedures. Then, it summarizes the obtained experimental results. Finally, it concludes with a discussion on how the acquired data could be used in a design procedure to find optimal tradeoffs between DET performance and lifetime/reliability.},

They are efficient candidates in many advanced technological applications such as actuators, artificial muscles, biomimetic sensors, etc. The manufacturing of electrodes for IPMCs is very critical in their electromechanical coupling. Force optimization, selection of cations and particle size distribution within the IPMC structure, etc. are the various factors, which determines their efficiency. In this chapter, we briefly discuss the structure, components and working mechanisms of IPMCs. The synthesis and characterizations of IPMCs are discussed in detail with the help of examples. A brief outlook on the modeling and potential applications of IPMCs is also included.},
