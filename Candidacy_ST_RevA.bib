	abstract = {In the wake of damaging earthquakes in both the United States and Japan over the past year, the performance of structures, in addition to traditional life-safety concerns, has become an important issue for designers and owners. Many possible approaches to enhancing the seismic performance of structures have been proposed, and one promising family of solutions which is receiving attention today is passive damping devices. The work presented here is part of an ongoing experimental and analytical study of the applicability of one particular type of damping device for controlling the response of civil structures. Two different types of reduced-scale dampers using shape memory alloys have been tested over a range of strain amplitudes, loading frequencies, and temperatures. The purpose of the tests was to thoroughly characterize an alloy and examine variations in device design and installation configurations that could lead to a number of different hysteretic shapes. The ultimate behavior of the devices was also examined. Parallel to the device development and testing, a series of analyses of a steel frame building incorporating shape memory alloys has been undertaken to quantify the benefits of using these devices in an actual structure. Preliminary results of these analyses are presented.},

In this paper, we propose a novel MSM based actuator exploiting the characteristics of MSMs. This device is a push-pull actuator where two pieces of MSM act in an opposite way. The magnetic fields are created by two magnetic coils supplied by current pulses. The hysteretic behaviour of the MSM permits to keep a stable position when no current is applied and so limits heat losses in the coils. A model of this actuator is proposed and validated by experiments. A precise position feedback control of the actuator is then achieved using a displacement laser sensor.},

The potential applications of this experiment include thermo-distortion compensation for precision space structure, stern shape control for submarines, and flap shape control for aeronautical applications. SMA wires are chosen as the actuating elements due to their high recovery stress ({\textgreater}500 MPa) and tolerance to high strain (up to 6\%). However, SMA wires are inherently nonlinear and pose a challenge for control design. A robust controller is designed and implemented to actively control the tip position of the composite beam. The experiment set-up consists of the composite beam with embedded SMA wires, a programmable current/voltage amplifier to actuate the SMA wires, an infrared laser range sensor to detect the beam tip displacement, and a real-time data acquisition and control system.

A geometrically nonlinear static analysis is first carried out to investigate the deformed shape of a flexible cantilever beam caused by an externally-attached SMA wire actuated electrically. The actuation force applied by the SMA actuator to the beam is evaluated by solving a coupled problem that combines a thermodynamic constitutive model of SMAs with the heat conduction equation in the SMA and the structural model of the beam. To calculate the temperature history of the SMA actuator for given electrical current input, the heat transfer equation is solved with the electrical resistive heating being modeled as a distributed heat source along the SMA wire. The steps in the formulation are connected together through an iterative scheme that takes into account the static equilibrium of the beam and the constitutive relation of SMAs, thus translating an electrical current history input into beam strain output. The proposed model is used to simulate the experimental results, thus demonstrating the feasibility of using SMA actuators for shape control of active flexible structural systems.},

First, the mechanical design of the torsion actuator is presented, followed by the fabrication of SMA torsion springs. Then, we present the constitutive model of the SMA torsion spring with an analysis of its strain change, and derive a quasi-static model with the Coulomb friction torque for this torsion actuator. Finally, a series of characterization experiments are conducted on the SMA torsion spring and the torsion actuator prototype to determine the values of all model parameters.

However, due to the slow actuation speed of SMAs, there are limitations in their range of possible applications. This paper proposes a smart soft composite (SSC) actuator capable of fast bending actuation with large deformations. To increase the actuation speed of SMA actuator, multiple thin SMA wires are used to increase the heat dissipation for faster cooling. The actuation characteristics of the actuator at different frequencies are measured with different actuator lengths and results show that resonance can be used to realize large deformations up to 35 Hz. The actuation characteristics of the actuator can be modified by changing the design of the layered reinforcement structure embedded in the actuator, thus the natural frequency and length of an actuator can be optimized for a specific actuation speed. A model is used to compare with the experimental results of actuators with different layered reinforcement structure designs. Also, a bend-twist coupled motion using an anisotropic layered reinforcement structure at a speed of 10 Hz is also realized. By increasing their range of actuation characteristics, the proposed actuator extends the range of application of SMA bending actuators.},

	abstract = {A new approach to the design and control of shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators is presented. SMA wires are divided into many segments and their thermal states are controlled individually as a group of ﬁnite state machines. Instead of driving a current to the entire SMA wire and controlling the wire length based on the analog strain–temperature characteristics, the new method controls the binary state (hot or cold) of individual segments and thereby the total displacement is proportional to the length of the heated segments, i.e. austenite phase. Although the thermomechanical properties of SMA are highly nonlinear and uncertain with a prominent hysteresis, segmented binary control is robust and stable, providing characteristics similar to a stepping motor. However, the heating and cooling of each segment to its bi-stable states entail longer time and larger energy for transition. In this paper, an efﬁcient method for improving the speed of response and power consumption is developed by exploiting the inherent hysteresis of SMA. Instead of keeping the extreme temperatures continuously, the temperatures return to intermediate ‘hold’ temperatures closer to room temperature but sufﬁcient to keep constant phase. Coordination of the multitude of segments having independent thermal states allows for faster response with little latency time even for thick SMA wires. Based on stress dependent thermomechanical characteristics, the hold temperature satisfying a given stress margin is obtained. The new control method is implemented using the Peltier effect thermoelectric devices for selective segment-by-segment heating and cooling. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an introduction to ionic polymer-metal composites and some mathematical modeling pertaining to them. It further discusses a number of recent findings in connection with ion-exchange polymer-metal composites (IPMCs) as biomimetic sensors and actuators. Strips of these composites can undergo large bending and flapping displacement if an electric field is imposed across their thickness. Thus, in this sense they are large motion actuators. Conversely by bending the composite strip, either quasi-statically or dynamically, a voltage is produced across the thickness of the strip. Thus, they are also large motion sensors. The output voltage can be calibrated for a standard size sensor and correlated to the applied loads or stresses. They can be manufactured and cut in any size and shape. In this paper first the sensing capability of these materials is reported. The preliminary results show the existence of a linear relationship between the output voltage and the imposed displacement for almost all cases. Furthermore, the ability of these IPMCs as large motion actuators and robotic manipulators is presented. Several muscle configurations are constructed to demonstrate the capabilities of these IPMC actuators. This paper further identifies key parameters involving the vibrational and resonance characteristics of sensors and actuators made with IPMCs. When the applied signal frequency varies, so does the displacement up to a critical frequency called the resonant frequency where maximum deformation is observed, beyond which the actuator response is diminished. A data acquisition system was used to measure the parameters involved and record the results in real time basis. Also the load characterizations of the IPMCs were measured and it was shown that these actuators exhibit good force to weight characteristics in the presence of low applied voltages. Finally reported are the cryogenic properties of these muscles for potential utilization in an outer space environment of a few Torrs and temperatures of the order of -140 degrees Celsius. These muscles are shown to work quite well in such harsh cryogenic environments and thus present a great potential as sensors and actuators that can operate at cryogenic temperatures.},

	abstract = {Shape memory alloys (SMA) are able to provide high work output when they undergo the martensitic transformation. Therefore, they present a favorable actuation mechanism for microsystems, e.g. for microvalves, switches or microgrippers. Sputter deposited thin SMA films are already in use as free-standing films or as composites in combination with a substrate. In the case of a composite, the substrate works as a bias spring and enables the SMA actuator to show a two way behavior. To enlarge the potentialities of shape memory based actuators a bistable principle is presented. This is realized by the combination with a polymer exhibiting a glass transition temperature (T$_{\textrm{g}}$) between the hysteresis loop of the shape memory composite. The fabrication of this composite is described with a special emphasis on the development of suitable polymer samples.},

This paper proposes a detailed electro-mechanical nonlinear model of the system, which is subsequently used to develop (in both time and frequency domains) various model-based feedback control laws. Accurate modeling is useful to compensate the nonlinear behavior of the actuator (caused by the material characteristics and geometry) and obtain PID controllers providing precise tracking of steps or sinusoidal reference signals.

	abstract = {Shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators deliver high forces while being compact and reliable, making them ideal for consideration in aerospace applications. One disadvantage of these thermally driven actuators is their slow cyclic time response compared to conventional actuators. Induction heating has recently been proposed to quickly heat SMA components. However efforts to date have been purely empirical. The present work approachs this problem in a computational manner by developing a finite element model of induction heating in which the time-harmonic electromagnetic equations are solved for the Joule heat power field, the energy equation is solved for the temperature field, and the linear momentum equations are solved to find the stress, displacement, and internal state variable fields. The combined model was implemented in Abaqus using a Python script approach and applied to SMA torque tube and beam actuators. The model has also been used to examine magnetic flux concentrators to improve the induction systems performance. Induction heating experiments were performed using the SMA torque tube, and the model agreed well with the experiments.},

	abstract = {Bistable structures are attractive morphing components because they can transform from one stable state to another simply through the application of an external force or moment. Each stable state is preserved despite the absence of a continuous energy supply. However, its competency is quite limited because most bistable composites (unsymmetric laminated bistable composites) have limited equilibrium shape configurations after curing. Most of them are cylindrical in shape. In this paper, for the first time, we present a saddle-shaped bistable panel that can be used for various soft-morphing applications. The mechanics of the saddle-shaped, bistable panel are investigated using the Rayleigh–Ritz approximation. A simple analytical model is proposed to obtain saddle bistability and deformations. Finite element (FE) numerical analysis is also performed to validate the analytical model approach. The numerical FE analysis shows good correlation with simple analytical solutions. Furthermore, for practical, smart-structure applications of the saddle-shaped bistable panel, the FE method simulated a snap-through action induced by a shape memory alloy (SMA) spring actuator. A simple design criterion for the snap-through action of a saddle composite panel actuated by an SMA spring component is suggested, based on the FE analysis.},

	abstract = {A shape memory alloy (SMA) coil spring actuator is fabricated by annealing an SMA wire wound on a rod. Four design parameters are required for the winding: the wire diameter, the rod diameter, the pitch angle and the number of active coils. These parameters determine the force and stroke produced by the actuator. In this paper, we present an engineering design framework to select these parameters on the basis of the desired force and stoke. The behavior of the SMA coil spring actuator is described in detail to provide information about the inner workings of the actuator and to aid in selecting the design parameters. A new static two-state model, which represents a force–deflection relation of the actuator at the fully martensitic state ( M 100\% ) and fully austenitic state ( A 100\% ), is derived for use in the design. Two nonlinear effects are considered in the model: the nonlinear detwinning effect of the SMA and the nonlinear geometric effect of the coil spring for large deformations. The design process is organized into six steps and is presented with a flowchart and design equations. By following this systematic approach, an SMA coil spring actuator can be designed for various applications. Experimental results verified the static two-state model for the SMA coil spring actuator and a case study showed that an actuator designed using this framework met the design requirements. The proposed design framework was developed to assist application engineers such as robotics researchers in designing SMA coil spring actuators without the need for full thermomechanical models.},

The primary actuator material is thermally activated Ni–Ti shape memory alloy (SMA), which exhibits remarkably high torque density. Despite the advantages of SMAs for actuator applications—high strain, silent operation, and mechanical simplicity—the response time and energy efficiency limit overall performance. As an alternative to SMA wires, thin SMA sheets are used to fabricate effective yet compact torsional actuators. Also, instead of using conventional Joule heating, an external Ni–Cr heating element is utilized to focus heat on the regions of highest required strain. Various design parameters and fabrication variants are described and experimentally explored in actuator prototypes. Controlled current profiles and discrete heating produces a 20\% faster response time with 40\% less power consumption as compared to Joule heating in a low-profile (sub-millimeter) torsional actuator capable of 180° motion.},
